added : setvalue syntax for reg_expand_sz was missing in the help

0.9.9
added : import will support the @ i.e default value syntax
added : multi level paths are handled by createkey and setvalue (i.e the full path will be created)
added : param after createkey can be empty

fixed : oem function improved
fixed : wrong value in enumallvalues under some circumstances
added : enumkeyr will recursively loop thru a key and its subkeys
added : setvaluebyteat a_reg_binary_value byte offset

fixed : setvalue error:"..." is an invalid integer on some integer
added : getvalue key " " 255 to display a binary into ascii
fixed : error control in deletekey
fixed : run command will no longer fail on one single error

toto review syntax for deletekey and createkey (no need to open the key first, we can use the api against the hive giving full path)
