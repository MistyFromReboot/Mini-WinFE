Windows Forensic Environment (WinFE)
====================================

There are a number of different version of WinFE, being based as it is
on the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE). The main versions 
are -

2.0   (codebase 6.0.6000)
2.1   (codebase 6.0.6001)
3.0   (codebase 6.1.7600)
3.1   (codebase 6.1.7601)
4.0   (codebase 6.2.9200)
5.x   (codebase 6.3.****)
10.x  (codebase 10.0.*****)

These are all available in 32 and 64-bit processor architectures. The
different versions behave differently. For more details and some tests
please see - http://mistyprojects.co.uk/documents/WinFE/winfe.htm. To 
summarise, WinFE 4.0/5.x offers more robust write protection. Earlier 
versions are known to write a disk signature to none Windows NT based
disks that do not already have one. 

I have not had the opportunity to carry out any in depth testing of 
WinFE 10.x builds, however based on initial tests they appear to function
identically to WinFE 4.0/5.x.

The ChrisPE project includes the following tool that can be used to
easily change a disk attributes (Read-Only / Read-Write and 
OFFLINE / ONLINE) - 

* DiskMgr - developed by Erwan.L. Available in native 32-bit and 
  64-bit version. 

DiskMgr can be used to mount a disk so that it can be written to - e.g. 
to copy an internal disk to an external disk. Care should be taken as 
it's also possible to remove the readonly flag from internal (evidence) 
disks - something that is not possible when using Diskpart in WinFE 
4.0/5.0 systems.

Earlier version of WinFE (2.*/3.*) do not mark disks as READONLY, the
WinFE registry settings merely stop disks from being mounted - hence the
use of the WProtect or DiskMgr tools. 

As an alternative to DiskMgr, use diskpart. Diskpart is a command-line 
tool. To use it, you must first give the "object" focus - any additional 
commands will then be carried out on the selected "object". An object 
can be a disk, volume or partition.  

Below is a quick run through of the commands required to mount a disk on 
the host and allow write access.


DISKPART> List Disks 
	This command will list all drives connected to the system.
	Select the drive to mount based on the attributes (e.g. size).
 
DISKPART> Select Disk 1 
	Identified from list in previous step. 
 
DISKPART> Detail Disk 
	If you are unsure of the disk selected, this command will 
	give you more information about it. 
 
DISKPART> Online Disk 
	If your destination drive is not online already, this will 
	put it online. 
 
DISKPART> List Volume  
	This command will list the volume(s) on your selected disk.
	Identify the one you want to work on and select it in the 
	following step.
 
DISKPART> Select Volume 1 
	Identified from preceding step.
 
DISKPART> Attribute volume clear readonly 
	This will set your destination disk to read/write.
	NOTE
	If you receive the error "The media is write protected..."
	then you are probably trying to work on an internal disk 
	using WinFE 4.0/5.0. This is not possible - refer to first 
	paragraph above!
 
DISKPART> Assign Letter=R 
	This will assign the drive letter (mount point) R: to
	the selected volume 
 
DISKPART> Exit
