                           select an alternate system root.
	--root                 Used in conjunction with the '-c --check' and '--sfc'
	                       options to specify a root directory different from the
	                       root directory used to produce the original baseline.

	--any               Specifies how the -A --attribute option is to be
	                    interpreted.  With '--any' files or streams with
	                    any one of the specified attributes will be
	                    processed.  The default is to hash files with all
	                    of the specified
	                    attributes.

The following are used to select files based upon file times:
   --modified [FILETIME]   selects files based upon the file
		                   modification time.
   --accessed [FILETIME]   selects files based upon the file access time.
   --created  [FILETIME]   selects files based upon the file creation
		                   time.
	
The format of the FILETIME string is specified according to the locale
of the current user.  For example, 10:00PM June 6, 2003 is specified
as "6/10/2003 10:00PM" in the United States and "10/6/2003 10:00PM"
in most european countries.  The file time string may be pre-pended by <, = or >
to search for file times that are less than, equal or greater than
the specified time string.  The FILETIME string may include multiple conditions
separated by a semi-colon (;).  Multiple conditions are evaluated in pairs.
An un-paired condition is evaluated individually.

The following may be used to select directories, files or streams
based upon specified regular expressions:

   --directoryfilter [EXPRESSION]   selects directories based upon an
	                                expression.
   --filefilter   [EXPRESSION]      selects files based upon an expression.
   --streamfilter [EXPRESSION]      selects alternate streams based upon an
	                                expression
   --magicfilter [EXPRESSION]       selects files or alternate streams based
                                    upon the binary contents at the start of
                                    the data stream as evaluated by an
                                    expression.

EXPRESSION may be any regular expression.  Double quotes ("")
may be used to prevent the command interpreter from splitting
a single expression into two or more pieces.  With respect
to the --magicfilter option, EXPRESSION is limited to a regular
expression that may be converted to a single byte character set.

The following may be used to select files or streams
based upon the entropy of the initial data stream:

   --entropy [THRESHOLD]   selects files or streams whose initial
	                   data streams have an entropy greater than THRESHOLD.

The following may be used in conjunction with output in xml format:
   --case [CASE NUMBER] includes the specified case number in xml output.
   --evidence [EVIDENCE NUMBER] specifies one less than the initial
                        evidence number.
   --description [DESCRIPTION] includes an optional description in xml output.

   --thread_priority [PRIORITY] sets the priority of the thread processing.
	
	The thread priority may be set to any of the following values:
		idle, lowest, belownormal, highest
		abovenormal, timecritical

Enterprise level options:

  --ssl [CERTIFICATE]	Make or receive TCP connections using the TLS 1.0 
         protocol and the specified certificate.  The certificate, which is
         optional for client connections, must be in PFX (PKCS#12) file
         format, if it exists.
  --encrypt [ALGORITHM]  Specifies the encryption algorithm that will be
         used to encrypt output.  The default algorithm is AES-256 on 
         Microsoft Windows XP and later and 3DES on Windows 2000.
  --cert [PATH] Provides the path to an X-509/PKCS#7 encoded file.  The 
         certificate will be used to encrypt the encryption key 
         that is used to encrypt output. 
   --ignore_invalid_cert  Ignore errors that may occur due to use of an
         unsigned or expired certificate.
