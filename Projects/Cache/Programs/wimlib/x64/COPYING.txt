Alternatively, when not prohibited by conflict with a third-party software
license, the library portion of wimlib may be redistributed and/or modified

the extent permitted by law.  See the file COPYING.LGPLv3 for more details.

----------------------------------------

NOTE! The primary reason for the GPL/LGPL "dual licensing" for the library is
that on UNIX-like systems, wimlib can optionally be linked to the third-party
library "libntfs-3g", which is licensed GPLv2+.  Under some interpretations of
the GPL, this would require that wimlib be licensed under the GPL as well.
However, a binary copy of wimlib that was compiled without libntfs-3g support
(for example; the exception may be applicable in other situations as well)
logically cannot be affected by libntfs-3g's license and should therefore be
free to be redistributed under the LGPL instead of the GPL.

NOTE! The file COPYING.CC0 contains a public domain dedication.  This public
domain dedication does not apply to wimlib as a whole, but rather to individual
source code files which the author(s) have elected to place into the public
domain, as noted in the corresponding file headers.  As usual, such code carries
NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.  See COPYING.CC0 for more details.
