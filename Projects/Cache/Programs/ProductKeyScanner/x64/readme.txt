Description
===========

Product Key Scanner is a tool that scans the Registry of Windows
Operating system and finds the product keys of Windows and other
Microsoft products. You can scan the Registry of your current running
system, as well as you can scan the Registry from external hard drive
plugged to your computer.
When scanning the product keys of your current running system, you can
also search product key stored in BIOS, and search product keys by using
WMI.




System Requirements
===================

This tool works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows XP, and
up to Windows 10. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported.



Known Limitations
=================


* If you purchased a computer from a large company, the product key
  displayed by this tool might be different from the product key you see
  on the sticker. It happens because the company uses the same duplicated
  disk with the same product key on all computers of the same model.
* You might see the same product key multiple times, simply because
  it's stored in multiple locations or because the key was found with
  multiple scan methods (Registry, BIOS, WMI).
* This tool can find your product key only if it's stored on your
  systems. For some license types, the product key is not stored in the
  Registry at all.



Version History
===============


* Version 1.01:
  o Added option to choose another font (name and size) to display in
    the main window.
  o Added option to change the sorting column from the menu (View ->
    Sort By). Like the column header click sorting, if you click again
    the same sorting menu item, it'll switch between ascending and
    descending order.

Start Using Product Key Scanner
===============================

Product Key Scanner doesn't require any installation process or
additional DLL files. In order to start using it, simply run the
executable file - ProductKeyScanner.exe

scan a system on external hard drive.

After the scan is finished, you can select one or more items in the main
window (or press Ctrl+A to select all items), and then export them to
csv/tab-delimited/XML/HTML file by using the 'Save Selected Items'
option. You can also copy the selected items to the clipboad (Ctrl+C) and
then paste them to Excel or other application. You can use the 'Copy
Product Key' option (Ctrl+K) if you want to copy to the clipboard only
the product key.
