To select files by first letters of names with Just Manager, you have to select the "Starts with filter" option in Configuration/Settings/Quick Search (filter).

It works fine and fast by the Alt F command.

The documentation of Just Manager clearly states that the default search and filtering patterns are "contains" patterns. It is also stated that there exists a checkable control to change this default option to "start with". See Documentation Configuration/Program Settings/Quick Search.
