  END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

  This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement 
  between you (either a natural person or juridical entity) and 
  the SOFTWARE author Dmitry Sidorov. By using the SOFTWARE you 
  agree to all terms of the EULA.

  1. GRANT OF LICENSE

  1.0. EDITIONS

  The scope of granted rights depends on the EDITION (license type) 
  and the number of license copies provided for you.

  The EDITION, the number of copies, and the number of supported OS 
  platforms is specified in your license order. For the EDITION, the 
  number of copies, and the license end date see also the SOFTWARE 
  "About" box (access is through the menu "Help"). If the number of 
  copies is not specified expressly then one (1) license is provided. 
  If the license end date is not specified then there is no time limit. 

  1.1. FREE EDITION

  For FREE EDITION only the paragraphs 1.1, 5, and 6 are applied.

  An unlimited number of FREE EDITION copies may be used for non-
  commercial purposes including educational purposes of institutions 
  and evaluation purposes. Only files from the current panel may be 
  recovered and no more than 4000 files at a time (per command call).

  You may reproduce and distribute FREE EDITION copies under the 
  following set of conditions only: the SOFTWARE is obtained directly 
  from the SOFTWARE author or on the SOFTWARE websites; keys and other 
  components of other EDITIONS are not transmitted; the composition 
  and components of the SOFTWARE are not changed (except for 
  reversible transcoding); the SOFTWARE origin, authorship, terms of 
  this EULA are available to the end user explicitly. FREE EDITION may 
  be included in free and paid packages.

  1.2.1. EDITIONS "EXPRESS" AND "PERSONAL": PERSONAL USE ONLY

  With the editions "EXPRESS" and "PERSONAL", you may use the SOFTWARE 
  for personal non-commercial purposes only. The usage in 
  organizations and any direct or indirect benefit are prohibited.

  1.2.2. STANDARD EDITION: USE FOR OWN NEEDS ONLY

  With STANDARD EDITION, you may use the SOFTWARE as a person or 
  organization for own needs only. Data recovery services for third 
  parties are prohibited. In particular, any organization or its 
  employee or other person providing data recovery services may not 
  use the SOFTWARE.

  1.3. RIGHTS TO RUN AND KEEP SOFTWARE COPIES

  You may simultaneously run instances of the SOFTWARE within the 
  number of provided license copies (the number of unfinished processes 
  must not exceed the number of license copies).

  In total, you may create and keep two (2) SOFTWARE copies more than 
  the number of license copies. A single copy may include multiple 
  SOFTWARE versions in the same data storage.

  2. ACTIVATION

  Activation associates the SOFTWARE run to a specific computer 
  hardware configuration and unlocks full SOFTWARE functionality. 
  Activation requires sending a hardware identification code to 
  SOFTWARE activation sites to obtain an unlocking code.

  Activation may be rejected if you run the SOFTWARE on more than 
  three (3) hardware configurations per year per license copy. The 
  CPU or motherboard change (including ROM-stored serial number 
  change), the use of additional virtualization imply the change 
  of hardware. Some other hardware or software changes may require 
  additional (allowed) SOFTWARE reactivation.

  If the license expires, you may continue using the SOFTWARE 
  in the previous environment, however, no support, including 
  reactivation, is provided.

  3. SOFTWARE UPDATES

  If the existing version support discontinues you may use the 
  succeeding available version, and the newer agreement replaces the 
  previous one in those stipulations only which clarify the terms and 
  explicitly enhance your rights. In other cases updates may be used 
  entirely under the terms of new supplied license agreements only.

  You may use previous available SOFTWARE versions under the terms 
  of this EULA too. However running previous versions (considering the 
  number before the first dot) is regarded as a run on a different 
  hardware assuming the restrictions of the paragraph 2.

  4. SOFTWARE UPGRADES

  Upgrade is a change of a complete set, the number of license copies, 
  or the EDITION. To apply the SOFTWARE upgrade, you must first have a 
  license that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon the upgrade, the new 
  agreement supersedes the previous one, and you may no longer use keys 
  and other components provided under the previous license.

  5. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS

  You may not use the SOFTWARE otherwise than expressly provided by 
  law, this EULA, and additional agreements with the SOFTWARE author.

  This EULA does not grant you rights to create derivative work, to 
  reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise study the 
  SOFTWARE code, nor to sell, rent, lease or sublicense the SOFTWARE.

  Violation of any EULA terms automatically terminates the EULA and 
  your rights to use the SOFTWARE.

  The SOFTWARE author retains all the rights of the author.

  6. LIMITED WARRANTY

  THE AUTHOR OF THE SOFTWARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY FOR 
  THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED DOCUMENTATION IS 
  PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES

  PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE REMAINS WITH YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL 
  THE AUTHOR OF THE SOFTWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER 
  ARISING OUT OF USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING

  PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, 
  PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER 
  LOSS WHATSOEVER), EVEN IF THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
