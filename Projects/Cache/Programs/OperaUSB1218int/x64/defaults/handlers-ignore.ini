; The black or white list of protocols web handlers can use. Supports '*' and '?' wildcards.
; In order to make it black the listed protocols' keys should have value 0 (e.g. html=0) and '*' wildcard key must be used with value 1.
; In order to make it white the listed protocols' keys should have value 1 (e.g. mailto=1) and '*' wildcard key must be used with value 0.
; Don't modify it unless you know what you're doing because misconfiguration may have bad side effects security-wise.
