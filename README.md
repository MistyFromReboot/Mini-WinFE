All you require to create a WinFE in a matter of minutes is the Mini-WinFE download, a Windows Source DVD (or mounted disc image) and any of the third party applications you want to include in the build - the WAIK or ADK is not required.

Mini-WinFE is based on Windows Preinstallation Environment, with a digital forensic focus. SysWOW64 is supported in 64-bit builds, allowing the use of some 32-bit Windows applications.
