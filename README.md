# Mini-WinFE

Windows Forensic Environmnent - based on WinPE. 

The PEBakery ChrisPE project has been used as a base. 

PEBakery version version 0.9.5.1 beta5 is included in the download. The Mini-WinFE project also tested using PEBakery version 1.0.0 (Standalone (x64): PEBakery-v1.0.0-sc_x64.7z). A decision has been made to retain version 0.9.5.1 beta5 in the download due to wider support on older versions of Windows - please note that the builder has a .NET 4.7.1 dependency.
