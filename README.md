# Mini-WinFE

Windows Forensic Environmnent - based on WinPE.

This project has evolved from the Winbuilder Mini-WinFE project. A move has been made to the PEBakery build engine. Use this project to create WinFE from a range of 32-bit and 64-bit Windows sources, including -

- Windows 7
- Windows 7 (SP1)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1
- Windows 8
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 8.1 Update
- Windows 10
- Windows 11

Mini-WinFE is based on Windows Preinstallation Environment, with a digital forensic focus. SysWOW64 is supported in 64-bit builds, allowing the use of some 32-bit Windows applications. 

PEBakery version 0.9.5.1 beta5 is included in the download. The Mini-WinFE project has also been tested using PEBakery version 1.0.0 (Standalone (x64): PEBakery-v1.0.0-sc_x64.7z). 

A decision has been made to retain version 0.9.5.1 beta5 in the download due to wider support on older versions of Windows including Windows 7 and 8.1 - please note that this version of the builder has a .NET 4.7.1 dependency.
